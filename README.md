# B-Tree Implementation in Go

B-Trees are amazing Trees variant with multiple useful feature which are highlighted when working with disk storage. It has the same time but a bit worse space complexity than Binary Search Trees (BSTs). It's space increases in the same order as BSTs, but in practice it takes up more space than needed, due to much extra space stored than used.

# Complexity Analysis

1. **Time** (_for all operations_): O(log N) 
2. **Space**: O(N)
